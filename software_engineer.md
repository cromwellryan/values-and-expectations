# Technical Skills / Team Expectations

## Planning / Preparation / Context

* Is aware of high-level business priorities and roadmap.

    * Can articulate how present initiatives and current work fit into the larger objectives.

* Is able to articulate individual workload and task status.

    * What have I completed?

    * What am I working on now?

    * What have I planned for the future?

    * How long are these tasks likely to take?

    * How does this impact others? Near-term plans? Longer term roadmap?

* Is aware of current and upcoming initiatives, relative progress and timeline, and who is responsible for leading/working each of these.

    * Can identify dependencies and interconnectivity between own work and other initiatives.

    * Collaborates with peers working other initiatives when necessary to mitigate risk.

* Seeks adequate articulation of scope, context, architecture plans, and rationale and high-level goals before starting new work.

* Ensures that work is done in small (as possible), shippable pieces

    * When tasks are not sufficiently decomposed, works with seniors or management to produce slice plan or more atomic stories.

    * Understands when to use global or customer-specific feature flagging to isolate shipped code.

* Partners with initiative leads and/or manager to author any artifacts needed to communicate plans to the team and to stakeholders.

## Producing

* Writes intelligible, high-quality code that is:

    * Readable (enough)

    * Performant (enough)

    * Secure (enough)

    * Idiomatic (enough)

* Creates well-crafted commits and pull requests that follow these guidelines,
  in descending order of importance:

    * Each commit represents a single conceptual change

    * Keep tests green from commit-to-commit (bisectable)

    * Contain concise, intelligible, and informative commit messages

    * Tell the larger story for reviewers, QA, and future-selves

    * Are individually revertable, when possible, or can be reverted
      up-to-and-including-this-commit and still have a working code base.

* Constantly improves the codebase.

    * When legacy, poorly-written, cumbersome, or confusing code is encountered, leaves things better than they were found (within reason).

* Is aware of and contributes to team-driven best practices around front- and back-end code style.

* Adheres to team-agreed best practices surrounding code reviews, pull requests and quality assurance efforts.

* Seeks out collaboration, pairing, or input from Senior Developers, Initiative Leads or Manager when unsure of how to approach a given problem or task.

## Reviewing

* Reviews the work of others with an eye toward best practices.

* Treats assigned code reviews as a first-class work object.

    * Completes code reviews in a timely fashion.

    * Checks on progress.

* Provides constructive, helpful feedback focused on making our codebase better and teaching others.

* Respectfully defends own rationale for choices if/when challenged during code review.

* Graciously acknowledges when reviewers' suggestion(s) make the code better.

* Makes changes effectively and in a timely manner.

## Shipping

* Articulates risks, dependencies, deployment steps in each Pull Request.

* Ensures post-deployment dependencies are understood and met (migrations, rake tasks, scripts, etc.).

* Ensures work can be deployed with minimal downtime.

* Is occasionally available for after-hours work to support deployments, new feature rollouts, maintenance, or production issues.

# Professionalism* *

* Regularly communicates status to the rest of the team, esp. when working remotely.

    * What you're working on.

    * Who you're working with.

* Engages in respectful, inclusive communication when interacting with peers.

* Respects otherâ€™s time and walks the fine line of knowing when to stretch and when to ask for help.

* Aware of and respects of the strengths and weaknesses of others.

* Aware of flex time / WFH / PTO privileges and exercises them responsibly and with an eye toward impact on the team. For example:

    * How does this affect my pair?

    * How does this affect my initiative?

    * Will others need to meet with me before I take time off?

* Able to diplomatically and respectfully argue in favor own code / architecture / strategy decisions when challenged.

* Routinely on time for meetings, particularly the morning stand-up.

* Escalates issues to initiative or team lead when necessary.

# Continuous Improvement

## Self

* Meets with Engineering Manager regularly on a one-to-one basis.

* Proactively seeks out opportunities to learn new skills or deepen existing ones.

* Maintains short-, medium-, long-term professional development goals (which may change over time), and records progress against goals in a consumable way.

* Showcases work to the rest of the company at the bi-weekly demo.

## Team

* Identifies and proposes process improvements, whether within the Engineering team or TTM as a whole.

* Shares knowledge about areas of subject-matter expertise via:

    * Pairing

    * Lunch and learns

    * Articles in Meta

* Proposes changes to team values and expectations or team mission as team evolves.

## Community

* Maintains an active presence in the development community at large:

    * OSS projects.

    * Attending or organizing meetups.

    * Giving talks at meetups or conferences.

    * Publishing dev-related content to social media.
