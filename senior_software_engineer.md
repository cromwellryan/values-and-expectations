#  Prerequisites

The Senior Software Developer is expected to meet all the expectations laid out for Software Developer. Additionally, the Senior Software Developer has shown the ability to "think bigger" about how the Engineering team fits within TTM as a whole. With this in mind, the Senior Developer should not only be able to continue to create software and perform code reviews, but also be expected to take a leadership role in ensuring initiatives are successful from their inception to their delivery. In addition, the Senior Developer actively mentors other developers and works closely with Product Management to communicate how newly developed features will impact TTMâ€™s internal stakeholders and its users. Additional responsibilities and expectations are outlined below.
